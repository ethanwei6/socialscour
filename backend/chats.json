Tenzingplasty Procedural Details Tenzingplasty was performed by advancing the Tenzing device over a 0.014\u201d microwire under fluoroscopic guidance. Intravenous heparin was administered in most cases, seeking to double baseline activated clotting time. The Tenzing device size was chosen at the discretion of the operator, selecting the device with OD that would best approximate but not exceed the normal segment diameter on premorbid angiography. Choice of [...] Tenzingplasty treatment effect can be achieved on all segments through which a Tenzing device is passed, whereas balloon PTA, Comaneci, or NeVa treatment effect can only be achieved at sites where the device is inflated or deployed. Tenzingplasty can achieve its result with a single pass through affected vessels, whereas angioplasty carries a risk for complications with each inflation of a balloon, which must often be performed on multiple segments to achieve adequate results due to shorter [..",

Subsequent balloon angioplasty or stenting was performed in 4% and 21%, respectively. Successful final reperfusion (expanded Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction 2b-3) was achieved in 81%, with one Tenzingplasty-related complication (a non-flow limiting dissection), and no perforations. In follow up, 25/44 (57%) had a 90-day modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2. [...] We identified 53 consecutive patients with symptomatic ICAD who underwent Tenzingplasty, median (IQR) age 63 (57-70) years, 29 (55%) male. ICAD locations were: M1 (24), M2 (9), internal carotid artery (3), vertebral V4 segment (7), basilar (8), vertebrobasilar junction (1), and A2 anterior cerebral arte",

          "content": "**Sentiment Explanation:**\nThe 35.0/100 (Negative) sentiment score is primarily driven by widespread dissatisfaction with the writing quality of \"Stranger Things Season 5,\" particularly concerning perceived plot holes and a general sense that the narrative has lost its direction. Fans express significant disappointment over the Duffer brothers' creative choices, leading to a negative assessment of the season's execution.\n\n**Direct Answer:**\nOverall, Reddit discussions indicate a predominantly negative sentiment towards \"Stranger Things Season 5,\" with users expressing significant concerns about the narrative's quality. Many feel that the writing has faltered, leading to numerous plot holes and a decline in the series' overall appeal compared to previous seasons.\n\n**Key Sentiment Drivers:**\n*   **Loss of Plot and Direction:** Users perceive that the writers have \"lost the plot\" for Season 5, especially in Volume 2, indicating a decline in narrative coherence [1].\n*   **Extensive Plot Holes:** The finale is heavily criticized for containing \"so many plot holes, it's unreal,\" which undermines the story's credibility [5].\n*   **Reluctance to Kill Main Characters:** Frustration exists over the creators' \"refuse to kill the main cast,\" which some believe diminishes stakes and makes the narrative feel less impactful [1].\n*   **Perceived Decline in Overall Quality:** Many consider Season 5 (even Volume 1) to be the \"worst season of stranger things\" and believe it \"doesn't even come close to the 4th season,\" highlighting a drop in enjoyment [6].\n\n**Contradicting Views:**\n*   **Unique Production Achievement:** The production is praised for a rare feat where \"every actor filmed their final scene on their actual\" last day, indicating a well-managed and respectful production process [2].\n*   **High Anticipation for Release:** Despite criticisms, there is significant anticipation for the season's release, with some calling it \"literally the only thing I was looking forward to this year,\" and speculation around specific dates like November 6th or Christmas Day [3, 4, 7].\n*   **Innovative Release Strategy:** The theatrical release of the finale on December 31st is noted as a \"significant part of this shift,\" suggesting a unique and ambitious approach to distribution [8].",
